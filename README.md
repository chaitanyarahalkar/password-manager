# A Secure Password Manager

### What is a Password Manager? 

A password manager can be a secure vault or encrypted storage that can store your passwords and other confidential data. This password manager uses a completely different approach for password storage. 


### Why Would You Need One? 

Internet has grown exponentially over the past decade, and as a consequence, the amount of data generated is increasing day by day. Online services are growing and to keep online services personalized and organised, online accounts are being created by users. Over the past few years, incidents of data breaches have surfaced over the Internet, and there are some which are not even public knowledge. Account passwords and personal information leaked from these data breaches are then misused or sold on the Internet. Cracking hashed passwords is not too difficult if the passwords among commonly used ones. A Google / Harris Poll conducted in February 2019 concluded that 52% people use the same password for multiple accounts. Hence, even if one of them is compromised, all of their accounts are consequently compromised.
